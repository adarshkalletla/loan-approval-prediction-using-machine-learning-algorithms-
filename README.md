 Banking sector offers a large variety of financial services out of which the sig
nificant amenities include payment services, custodial and safety support, loan
 application assistance and credit card options. Machine Learning and Data Sci
ence has a vast application in the field of Banking sector. These domains play
 significant role in the field of loan prediction which helps in fraud detection, risk
 management system, maintaining efficiency, transparency and helping in contin
uous improvement. Due to the increasing rate of loan defaults, itâ€™s a difficult task
 for the banking authorities to assess the loan requests and deal with the risks of
 customers defaulting the loan. An automatic loan prediction system is developed
 using machine learning models where the machine learns and predicts whether
 to approve the loan or not based on the eligibility criteria. Six prediction models
 including Logistic Regression Model, Decision tree, Random Forest, Support Vec
tor Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier and XG-Boost algorithm have been
 performed. A comparative analysis is carried out between the models where the
 performance metrices for each model is calculated and compared based on which
 the best suitable model for predicting the loan approval status is concluded.
